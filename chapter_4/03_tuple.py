# A tuple in Python is an ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collection of items, used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuples are defined by enclosing elements in parentheses () and separating them with commas. 

# Key Characteristics

# Ordered: The items in a tuple have a defined order, which will not change.
# Immutable: Once a tuple is created, you cannot change, add, or remove its items. This immutability ensures data integrity and makes tuples more memory-efficient than lists.
# Allows Duplicates: Because they are indexed, tuples can have items with the same value.
# Heterogeneous: Tuples can contain items of different data types (strings, integers, floats, and even other tuples or lists).

# Difference between tuple and List : Lists are mutable while tuples aren't.
